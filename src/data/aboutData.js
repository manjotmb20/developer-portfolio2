    description2: "I have nearly three years of professional experience as a software engineer, where I designed & developed high quality mobile applications for Android. As an Android developer, I paid great attention to detail and design of my work. Writing clean code that is easy to maintain and designing app architecture that scales well as additional, more complex features are added to a project were some of my major endeavors. In my recent years of software engineering, I spent my time exploring other interesting computer science fields - primarily distributed systems where I focussed on creating backend services that could operate on a large scale and handle immense load and user-traffic.",
